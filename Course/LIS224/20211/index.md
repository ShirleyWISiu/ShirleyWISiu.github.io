# LIS224 Programming Concepts 
2020/2021 Semester 1 

## MODULE DESCRIPTION
The logic behind Programming concepts are an important knowledge for business administrators. This module provides a practical overview of the programming logic aspects for the BBA students with the aim to develop their logical reasoning process and improve their decision making.

## MODULE PREREQUISITES
No prerequisites are formally defined by the University.

## MODULE AIMS
This module introduces basic concepts of algorithmic problem solving and logical thinking. It covers problem solving strategies, basic data structures, as well as data and procedural abstraction. Through step-by-step practice, students learn basic skill to write their own code in an easy-to-master programming language for simple problem solving, and to perform simple debugging and testing. This module is intended for students with little or no programming exerience. 

## KEY CONTENTS
Students who complete this program will acquire knowledge about programming:
- To create logical tests
- To create variables, arrays and save data
- To create loops
- To perform mathematical and logical operations
- To use programming applications and understand their behavior

## MAIN TEACHING AND LEARNING STRATEGIES
All classes are planned to provide both theory and practical in a computer laboratory.
