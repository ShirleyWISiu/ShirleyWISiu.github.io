## Call for Post-Doctoral Applications 
([中文版](vacancy_cn.md))

We are proposing a new applied project **Development of an adaptive biological function prediction software system for multifaceted peptides** under the funding scheme of *Postdoctoral Researchers of High Education Institutions of FDCT*. Associated with this project, 1 postdoctoral candidate from **Computer Science**, **Bioinformatics**, **Computer-Aided Drug Design**, or related areas is sought. 


The postdoctoral researcher will participate in the development of a novel adaptive software system which integrates ML and AI methods for bioactive peptide discovery. The main tasks include data collection, processing, design and implementation of prediction models, and integration into a unified framework. Reimplementation and refinement of some state-of-the-art AI methods are expected.
