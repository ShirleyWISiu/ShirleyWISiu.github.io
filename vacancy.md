We are proposing a new applied project “Development of an adaptive biological function prediction software system for multifaceted peptides” under the funding scheme of Postdoctoral Researchers of High Education Institutions of FDCT. Associated with this project, 1 postdoctoral candidate from Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Computer-Aided Drug Design, and related areas is sought. 

The postdoctoral researcher will participate in the development of a novel adaptive software system which integrates ML and AI methods for bioactive peptide discovery. The main tasks include data collection, processing, design and implementation of prediction models, and integration into a unified framework. Reimplementation and refinement of some state-of-the-art AI methods are expected.

This project is led by Prof. Shirley Siu (https://cbbio.online), who will start a new research group at ISE in September 2021. Her research focuses on algorithm design and solution implementation for computer-aided drug design, nature-inspired optimization, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics.

Requirements of candidate: 
- PhD degree (obtained within the previous 5 years for a Macao resident and 1 year for a non-Macao resident)
- Publications in SCI journals in the areas of ML/Bioinformatics
- Strong programming skills, evidenced by project examples (e.g. Github projects)
- Knowledge of popular deep learning frameworks (e.g. PyTorch)
- Excellent English communication, presentation, and writing abilities

Employment conditions:
- Monthly salary MOP 30,000 (about USD 3700)
- Full time, up to 2 years

Application deadline: 
- For applications received before 20 August 2021, the selected candidate will be included in the fund proposal

Application documents:
- Curriculum Vitae 
- Copies of 2-3 selected scientific publications
- PhD degree certificate (with final thesis document) 
- University-level transcripts
- Identification document
- Supporting documents showing the ranking of universities from which higher education degrees were obtained. 

For application and inquiries, please contact the project leader Shirley Siu (siuwengin@gmail.com).
