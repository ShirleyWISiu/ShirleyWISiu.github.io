<!---
Shirley was born in Macau. She completed her B.Sc. and M.Sc. degree in Software Engineering at University of Macau. In 2006, she received her second M.Sc. degree from the Center of Bioinformatics at Saarland University. Afterwards, she joined the Theoretical and Computational Membrane Biology group at the same University where she received her PhD degree (Dr. rer. nat.) from the Physics Department in 2010. Then, she continued one-year of post-doctoral training in the Computational Biology group at the University of Erlangen. She was the recipient of the academic excellence award in Macau Foundation Prize for First Honor Degree graduates in UM in 1997, the fellowship award in the Max Planck Research School for Computer Science from 2003-2005, and the doctoral scholarship in the Graduate School of Physics at Saarland University from 2006-2009.

Currently, she is an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science at University of Macau. From September 2021, she will join the Institute of Science and Environment at the University of Saint Joseph as an associate research professor. Her research involves theoretical study and computer simulations of biomolecular processes with the aim of explaining and predicting the behavior of complex systems. She is also interested in machine learning and its application to problems in drug discovery, medical decision making, and bioinformatics. 

She has written/co-authored more than 60 peer-reviewed journal papers and conference papers. According to Google Scholar statistics, her papers are cited more than 1,400 times, and the author's H index is 15. She has been the principal investigator (PI) of the Computational Biology Laboratory 
[CBBIO](https://cbbio.online) of the University of Macau since 2015. She has successfully supervised more than 40 students, including PhD, master, and bachelor, and participated in supervising doctoral students from the Faculty of Chinese Medicine and Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau. Her research has received various funding from the Macau government and the university, totaling MOP 4.5 million. 

She is the member of the Asian Association for Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD-Asia) society and Macau Computational Pharmacy Society. She has also served as the program committee member for many international bioinformatics and biomedical conferences.
