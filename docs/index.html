We are proposing a new applied project “Development of an adaptive biological function prediction software system for multifaceted peptides” under the funding scheme of Postdoctoral Researchers of High Education Institutions of FDCT. Associated with this project, 1 postdoctoral candidate from Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Computer-Aided Drug Design, and related areas is sought. 

The postdoctoral researcher will participate in the development of a novel adaptive software system which integrates ML and AI methods for bioactive peptide discovery. The main tasks include data collection, processing, design and implementation of prediction models, and integration into a unified framework. Reimplementation and refinement of some state-of-the-art AI methods are expected.

This project is led by Prof. Shirley Siu (https://cbbio.online), who will start a new research group at ISE in September 2021. Her research focuses on algorithm design and solution implementation for computer-aided drug design, nature-inspired optimization, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics.
