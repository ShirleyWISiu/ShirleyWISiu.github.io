Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a valuable source of antimicrobial agents and a potential solution to the multi-drug resistance problem. In particular, short-length AMPs have been shown to have enhanced antimicrobial activities, higher stability, and lower toxicity to human cells. We present a short-length (less than 30 aa) AMP prediction method, Deep-AmPEP30, developed based on an optimal feature set of PseKRAAC reduced amino acids composition and convolutional neural network. On a balanced benchmark dataset of 188 samples, Deep-AmPEP30 yields an improved performance of 77% in accuracy, 85% in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and 85% in area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) over existing machine learning-based methods. To demonstrate its power, we screened the genome sequence of Candida glabrata—a gut commensal fungus expected to interact with and/or inhibit other microbes in the gut—for potential AMPs and identified a peptide of 20 aa (P3, FWELWKFLKSLWSIFPRRRP) with strong anti-bacteria activity against Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The potency of the peptide is remarkably comparable to that of ampicillin. 

Deep-AmPEP30 is a promising prediction tool to identify short-length AMPs from genomic sequences for drug discovery. This method, together with our previous AMP predictor for longer-length peptides (AmPEP), are available at the **one-stop server [AxPEP](https://app.cbbio.online/ampep/home)** for both individual sequence prediction and genome screening for AMPs.
